## About me
My full name is Alena Churakova.
I’m a fourth-year student of Moscow International Institute, the faculty of Linguistics. I’ve decided to try something new and switched to Frontend because I've already worked in different spheres and I realised that programming is a better choice for me. I chose Frontend development because I like seeing the results of my work and I already had some experience with HTML when I was a child and I liked it.
Now I am looking for my first job as a developer.

## Coding examples

```js
function calculateTotalMortgage(percent, contribution, amount, monthsQuantity) {
	const monthlyPercent = percent / 100 / 12;
	const loanAmount = amount - contribution;
	const monthlyPayment = loanAmount * (monthlyPercent + (monthlyPercent / (Math.pow(1 + monthlyPercent, monthsQuantity) - 1)));
	const totalPayment = monthlyPayment * monthsQuantity;
	const roundedTotalPayment = Math.round(totalPayment * 100) / 100;
	return roundedTotalPayment;
    }
const totalPayment = calculateTotalMortgage(10, 20000, 150000, 12);
console.log(totalPayment); 
```
